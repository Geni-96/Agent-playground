# Stream-Aware Agent Playground

🔍 **Turn your app into an LLM agent testing platform, where agents are represented as participants and communicate through voice/audio, not just text.**

## 🎯 Overview

The Stream-Aware Agent Playground is an AI Agent Simulator designed to test and demonstrate multi-agent interactions with **full voice communication capabilities**. Each agent has its own persona (system prompt), and agents can communicate through voice in real-time using WebRTC, ASR (speech-to-text), LLM processing, and TTS (text-to-speech). This creates a complete voice conversation loop between AI agents and human participants.

## ✨ Features (Phase 3 Complete - WebRTC Voice Integration)

- ✅ **Multi-Agent System**: Create and manage multiple AI agents with unique personas
- ✅ **Message Bus**: Redis-powered pub/sub system for agent communication
- ✅ **REST API**: HTTP endpoints to interact with agents and rooms
- ✅ **Agent Orchestration**: Centralized agent management and coordination
- ✅ **Real-time Communication**: Agents can send direct messages or broadcast to all
- ✅ **LLM Integration**: Intelligent responses using OpenAI GPT or Anthropic Claude
- ✅ **Text-to-Speech**: Voice synthesis using ElevenLabs, Azure TTS, or PlayHT
- ✅ **Speech Recognition**: Real-time ASR using OpenAI Whisper, Deepgram, or Azure Speech
- ✅ **WebRTC Integration**: Agents join Mediasoup rooms as virtual participants
- ✅ **Voice Pipeline**: Complete audio flow from speech input to agent voice response
- ✅ **Turn-taking**: Intelligent conversation flow and speaking queue management
- ✅ **Audio Processing**: Real-time format conversion and streaming optimization

## 🔌 Redis Channels

The system uses several Redis channels for communication:

- `agent:create` - Trigger agent creation
- `agent:delete` - Trigger agent deletion
- `agent:message` - Direct messages between agents
- `agent:broadcast` - Broadcast messages to all agents
- `agent:created` - Notification when agent is created
- `agent:deleted` - Notification when agent is deleted

## 🧪 Testing the System

### 1. Create agents via API:
```bash
# Create a helpful agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"persona": "You are a helpful AI assistant."}'

# Create a creative agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"persona": "You are a creative AI that loves storytelling."}'
```

### 2. Join agents to WebRTC room (Phase 3):
```bash
# Get agent ID from previous response
AGENT_ID="your-agent-id-here"

# Join agent to voice room
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/agents/$AGENT_ID/join-room \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"roomId": "voice-room", "options": {"enableAudio": true}}'

# Start agent speaking
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/agents/$AGENT_ID/speak \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello! I am ready to participate in voice conversations."}'
```

### 3. View created agents and rooms:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/agents
curl http://localhost:3000/rooms
```

### 4. Send messages via Redis:
```bash
# Connect to Redis CLI
redis-cli

# Create an agent
PUBLISH agent:create '{"persona": "You are a philosophical AI."}'

# Send a broadcast message
PUBLISH agent:broadcast '{"content": "Hello everyone!", "from": "system"}'
```
